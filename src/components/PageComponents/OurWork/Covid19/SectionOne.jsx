        <h3>What is unique about this new product?</h3>
        <p>
          Guardian Storm Light depends on nanometer materials, such as
          nanosilver and titanium dioxide, to kill the virus and bacteria. UV
          Light is just used to activate the activity of nanosilver and titanium
          dioxide which can easily kill the virus and bacteria. This latest LED
          panel with air circulation works as a regular LED panel light during
          disinfection with the nanosilver and titanium dioxide!
