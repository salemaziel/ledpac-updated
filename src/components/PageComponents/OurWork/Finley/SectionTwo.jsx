            To do the job, LEDpac needed to put in 800 SLP siliconized pure
            white LEDs. These were chosen because of their long 60,000-hour life
            rating. Every two inches there was an SLP module for a total of 800
            SLP modules using a total of 1600 LEDs. LEDpac power supplies and an
            air circulation system were also part of the solution to assure the
            long life of the final solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            The LEDpac team would have preferred to mount the lights in a slide
            in tray to allow upgrades and service access but in this case these
            LED s were permanently installed. This was accepted because the
            quality and 60,000 hours life of the product allowed the permanent
            installation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The effect achieved was dramatic and unique. The counter has the
            appearance of a full moon on the horizon.

            <h3>Improved Color of Light</h3>
            LEDpac chose a specific LED color blend which has a unique quality
            of light. The increased color temperature of the light source
            provides a cooler light which is more flattering to the typical
            diamond. Warmer light tends to make the typical diamond or other gem
            stone more yellow and less clear in appearance. The cooler light
            makes the product more white which is psychologically more "clear."
            The current trend toward white metals tends to be complimented more
            by the cooler light sources. Unlike the halogen lamps in the
            original display, the LEDs emit no UV energy, thus decreasing the
            fading of products and display backgrounds.
          </p>
          <h3>Master Bath and Wine Room</h3>

          <p>
            The success on this challenging lighting problem encouraged the
            customer to look at other areas where lighting challenges existed in
            the residence.
          </p>
          <p>
            LEDpac was asked to also install backlighting on the two 8 X 2 foot
            counters in the master bathroom and then again in the wine room
            which has a large tasting counter centered in a room with three full
            walls of wine bottle storage. The wine room had a 4 X 9 foot Onyx
            counter with a sink. Since this was the same challenge as the
            kitchen, this counter was also backlit with 600 SLP packages.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the counter lighting setting a high standard for wine room
            lighting, the customer wanted accent lighting for the wine racks
            that covered all three walls of the wine room.
          </p>
          <p>
            The wine storage racks are built with a rectangular grid rosewood
            frame. The frame is lit with white LEDpac Microlite so that the wine
            bottle storage cells are highlighted. This required five rolls of
            Microlites with 360 LEDs in each of the rolls. These wine racks had
            a track over the rows of bottles that contain the white Microlite
            LEDs. With the LEDpac's LED solution the customer gets accent
            lighting without any UV light on the wine and each bottle is lit
            from above in a pleasing manner with low energy lighting.
          </p>

          <h3>Master Bedroom</h3>

          <p>
            The next lighting challenge is in the master bedroom where there are
            two large walk-in dressing rooms. Each dressing room is built with
            12-foot tall cabinets with mirrored glass doors with a four-inch
            wood framing around the glass. The challenge was to develop a way to
            light each of these doors at the bottom from inside. The goal was to
            see through the glass when lit but for the glass to be mirrored when
            not lit.
          </p>
          <p>
            The solution was to use an enclosed lighting system with the LEDs
            covered in a sealed package. LEDpac installed Treklite with XLP
            modules at the bottom of the closet with a diffused cap to make the
            light spread better and not be distracting to view. There is a total
            of 50 feet linear of cabinets in master dressing room and 25 feet in
            the other dressing room. The fixtures took 300 patent pending,
            LEDpac XLPs mounted into the Treklite fixture using protective and
            diffusing caps. These protective caps enabled the doors to be
            backlit and allowed the light to be diffused so the person in front
            of the cabinets does not have the lights glare right in their eyes.
            The Treklite package is rugged and durable enough to be used in this
            space where the light is exposed to rough treatment.
          </p>

          <p>
            To complete the dramatic affect in the dressing rooms, additional
            indirect lighting was installed in the space above the cabinets. In
            the Master dressing room there are 2 to 3 feet of space above
            cabinets. To achieve good lighting for the room without a visible
            fixture, LEDpac placed Amber SLP lights above the cabinets to create
            a warm sunset lighting affect about the whole room above the
            cabinets.
          </p>

          <h3>Lighting Fixtures</h3>

          <p>
            <span className="image left">
              <img src={Finley18} alt="airport" />
            </span>
            Mrs. Finley had a new custom crystal chandelier fixture design she
            wanted to create for the home. Amy Finley developed the design
            concept and LEDpac was tasked with turning the idea into a real
            fixture.
          </p>
          <p>
            The custom chandelier was designed and built to light spaces in the
            kid's bedroom, the kid's bathroom, the spa room, the mater bathroom,
            and the veranda (an entry way in the master area). In the end this
            Custom lighting fixture project in the Finley residence was so
            successful that it will be converted into a customizable standard
            product for Finley Design, Mrs. Finley's lighting fixture and design
            business.
            <p>
              The fixture consists of a chrome circular cylinder suspended from
              the ceiling by a chrome-plated rod. The top and bottom of this
              cylinder are clear Acrylic to allow both up lighting and down
              lighting. Each cylinder is custom sized for the installation with
              the cylinder varying from 8 to 24 inches (11 total fixtures).
            </p>
            <p>
              <span className="image right">
                <img src={Finley19} alt="airport" />
              </span>
              LEDpac installed high brightness XLP modules on the topside of the
              cylinder for indirect up illumination. On the bottom side of each
              of the discs there is also down illumination using a total of 350
              XLPs. This down illumination is the most dramatic part of the
              fixture and it was only achievable using LEDs.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Chrome ringed cylinder creates a cylindrical space between two
              clear discs. This chamber has LEDpac LEDs at the top of the
              chamber directing light down and the rest of the chamber is filled
              with small crystal spheres so that the LED light scatters through
              these crystals. Also hanging down from the bottom clear plate are
              strings with crystals handing down from the plate The affect of
              the light through the crystal spheres is to fill the lit space
              with light rays scattered through out the room in innumerable
              points of light.
            </p>
            <p>
              The fixture can be dimmed on both the bottom and top zone
              separately. This custom fixture is so successful that the owner
              incorporated the design into their lighting and design business.
              This fixture is now a product offered by Finley design which will
              now offer the custom chandelier lights using the LEDpac XLP. To
              convert this fixture into a standard product LEDpac developed a
              small controller power pack to put into the light fixture. This
              will be a custom product to sell through Finley designs. These
              lights will get 50K hours of product life and have extremely low
              energy use. These two benefits are additional bonus features of
              the fixture for prospective customers. The flexibility of the XLP
              lights allows the fixtures to be designed in any custom shape
              required for the customer.
            </p>
            <p>
              The enthusiasm of the customer due to the exceptional results of
              the projects above led to even more lighting installations.

          <h3>FirePlace</h3>

          <p>
            The fireplace front also has the onyx surface and this was backlit
            over the whole face. Also outside there are 200 MR-16 format lights
            for decorative lighting.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Energy Savings</h3>
          <p>
            The customer realized that these lights were going to consume a
            large amount of energy. The power consumption is 50 Watts X 200
            fixtures for a total of 10,000 watts which was a concern for the
            owner. The warm white 30 degree spread MR-16 light product of LEDpac
            was used to bring the current draw down and bring the power
            requirement down to 3 watts with 50K hours of life, bringing the
            total load down to 600 watts. The light uses 3 watts while producing
            incredible light output. This is a 16X reduction in power used for
            these lights.
          </p>

          <h3>What was the end result?</h3>

          <p>
            The objective was to achieve dramatic lighting for the home and
            maintain manageable energy costs and low maintenance cost. The
            LEDpac products met and exceeded the customer's expectations for the
            custom backlighting, accent lighting, and custom fixture building.
            The results were so spectacular that the customer applied LED
            lighting to additional lighting needs on the project such as
            under-cabinet lighting, wall washes, and exterior accent lighting.
            Additionally, the customer wants to use the LEDpac products for a
            second custom home design. Finley Designs is considering investing
            in products for inventory. So while the project shows the
            versatility of LEDpac products, it only shows the beginning of a
            collaboration that is still ongoing in new building projects.
