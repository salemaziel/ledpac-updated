*If you need 62mm (2.44in) tenon pole adapter, you need to follow these steps before installing:
                  Figure1                          Figure2                   Figure3
1.When you receive the light, as shown in Figure 1. There are 3pcs washers and 6pcs M6*20
    screws.Pull the screws in the direction of the arrow.
2.When the screws and washers are in the position of Figure 2, place the lights into the pole.
3.Then tighten the screws as shown in Figure 3.
 *If you only need 80mm (3.15in) tenon pole adapter, use 6pcs M8*20 screws to fix it. Do not
  use M6*20 screws and washers.
